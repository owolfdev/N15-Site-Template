One of the standout features of MDX (Markdown with JSX) in Next.js 14 is its ability to blend static content with dynamic components. This allows for the creation of interactive, rich experiences directly within your Markdown files. In this article, we’ll walk through how to create and use a dynamic component in an MDX file that includes an input and a button. When the button is clicked, it will display the input text in a popup message.

<DynamicInputPopup />

### Creating the Dynamic Component

First, we’ll create a dynamic component that will include an input field and a button. This component will be placed in the `/app/components/examples/` directory.

Here’s how the component might look:

```jsx
// File: /app/components/examples/dynamic-input-popup.tsx

import React, { useState } from "react";

export default function DynamicInputPopup() {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState("");
  const [showPopup, setShowPopup] = useState(false);

  const handleButtonClick = () => {
    if (inputValue) {
      setShowPopup(true);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div className="pb-4">
      <input
        type="text"
        value={inputValue}
        onChange={(e) => setInputValue(e.target.value)}
        placeholder="Type something..."
        className="border p-2 rounded-md"
      />
      <button
        type="button"
        onClick={handleButtonClick}
        className="ml-2 bg-blue-500 p-2 rounded-md"
      >
        Show Popup
      </button>
      {showPopup && (
        <div className="flex flex-col gap-4 mt-4 p-4 border rounded-md">
          <p>{inputValue}</p>
          <button
            type="button"
            onClick={() => setShowPopup(false)}
            className="bg-red-500 text-white p-2 rounded-md"
          >
            Close
          </button>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Importing and Using the Component in an MDX File

Next, we’ll import this component into an MDX file and use it directly within the content.

Here’s an example MDX file:

```MDX
export const metadata = {
  id: "4NZFYL3oLaRFSy8BaEAc7H",
  type: "blog",
  title: "Integrating Dynamic Components in MDX Files in Next.js 14",
  author: "O Wolfson",

  categories: ["Web Development"],
  tags: ["mdx", "custom", "components"],
};

import DynamicInputPopup from "@/components/examples/dynamic-input-popup";

# Integrating Dynamic Components in MDX

MDX allows you to seamlessly combine static Markdown content with dynamic React components. In this example, we’ll demonstrate how to use a custom component that takes user input and displays it in a popup.

<DynamicInputPopup />
```

In the MDX file, the `DynamicInputPopup` component is imported just like any other React component. The key difference is that it is directly used within the MDX content, providing an interactive experience.

### Setting Up the MDX File to Handle Dynamic Imports

In your Next.js configuration, ensure that MDX is set up to support dynamic imports if it's not already. You might have something similar to this in your `next.config.js`:

```javascript
const withMDX = require("@next/mdx")({
  extension: /\.mdx?$/,
});

module.exports = withMDX({
  pageExtensions: ["js", "jsx", "md", "mdx"],
});
```

This setup allows Next.js to understand MDX files and ensures that you can import components dynamically.

### Conclusion

By following the steps above, you’ve successfully integrated a dynamic component into an MDX file in Next.js 14. This approach enhances the interactivity of your blog or documentation site, making it more engaging for users. The possibilities are endless—whether you need forms, sliders, or other dynamic elements, MDX with Next.js allows you to create content that goes beyond static text and images.

Happy coding!
