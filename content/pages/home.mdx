Our mission is to take the friction out of content creation. We wanted a blogging platform that was easy to use, developer friendly - and that makes content creation a pleasure, so we built one with Next.js and MDX.

[See the installation options for MDXBlog](/install).

We regularly publish content, including articles, tutorials, and news covering MDX, Next.js, and other static site generation frameworks. [Click here to start reading](/blog).

## More About <span className="text-primary">MDX</span>Blog

Unlike some blogging solutions that rely on a database to store content, content management in MDXBlog is handled by easily editable Markdown (mdx) files in a folder on your local machine! Content creation with local files just feels more intuitive.

MDXBlog is a free, open-source project that is easy to install and deploy. It's created app built with the latest web technologies, offering a unique blogging experience. Using MDX (Markdown + JSX) and Next.js 14, it generates static pages that are fast, secure, and SEO-friendly. The app is designed to be easy to use and customize, with a clean, modern design that is fully responsive and mobile-friendly.

We have no official affiliation with the MDX team or Next.js, we are simply fans of the technology and wanted to create a simple, free, easy-to-use blog template for ourselves and to share with any other interested developers.

MDX blends Markdown's straightforward syntax with the capability to embed dynamic JSX elements. Perfect for interactive, rich-content blogs.
